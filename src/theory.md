The Atterberg limits are a basic measure of the nature of a fine grained soil. Depending on the water content of the soil, it may appear in four states: 
1. Solid
2. Semi-solid
3. Plastic 
4. Liquid

In each state the consistency and behavior of a soil is different and thus so are its engineering properties. Thus, the boundary between each state can be defined based on a change in the soil's behavior. The Atterberg limits can be used to distinguish between silt and clay, and it can distinguish between different types of silts and clays. 

The definitions of the consistency limits proposed by Atterberg are not, by themselves, adequate for the determination of their numerical values in the laboratory, especially in view of the arbitrary nature of these definitions. In view of this, Arthur Casagrade and others suggested more practical definitions with special reference to the laboratory devices and methods developed for the purpose of the determination of the consistency limits.

### Shrinkage Limit
The shrinkage limit (SL) is the water content where further loss of moisture will not result in any more volume reduction. The shrinkage limit is much less commonly used than the liquid limit and the plastic limit.

### Plastic Limit
The plastic limit (PL) is the water content where soil starts to exhibit plastic behavior. A thread of soil is at its plastic limit when it is rolled to a diameter of 3 mm or begins to crumble. To improve consistency, a 3 mm diameter rod is often used to gauge the thickness of the thread when conducting the test (AKA Soil Snake Test).

### Liquid Limit 
Liquid limit (LL) is defined as the arbitrary limit of water content at which the soil is just about to pass from the plastic state into the liquid state. At this limit, the soil possesses a small value of shear strength, losing its ability to flow as a liquid. In other words, the liquid limit is the minimum moisture content at which the soil tends to flow as a liquid.
