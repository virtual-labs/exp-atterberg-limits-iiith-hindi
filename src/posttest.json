			"question": "1. The liquid limit (LL), plastic limit (PL) and shrinkage limit (SL) of a cohesive soil satisfy which of the following relations?",
			"answers": {
				"a": "LL > PL > SL",
				"b": "LL > PL < SL",
				"c": "LL < PL < SL",
				"d": "LL < PL > SL"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "Liquid limit will have more water content and the state of soil changes from plastic state to liquid state. Similarly, at plastic limit the state of soil changes from semi-solid state to plastic state where there is considerable shear strength and the soil offers considerable resistance to flow. As the water content of a dry soil is increased, the soil state changes from solid state to semi-solid state and this limit is called shrinkage limit. Hence, liquid limit > plastic limit > shrinkage limit.",
				"b": "The plastic limit cannot be less than the shrinkage limit. At plastic limit the state of soil changes from semi-solid state to plastic state where there is considerable shear strength and the soil offers considerable resistance to flow. As the water content of a dry soil is increased, the soil state changes from solid state to semi-solid state and this limit is called shrinkage limit.",
				"c": "The plastic limit cannot be less than the shrinkage limit. At plastic limit the state of soil changes from semi-solid state to plastic state where there is considerable shear strength and the soil offers considerable resistance to flow. As the water content of a dry soil is increased, the soil state changes from solid state to semi-solid state and this limit is called shrinkage limit.",
				"d": "The liquid limit cannot be less than the plastic limit. Liquid limit will have more water content and the state of soil changes from plastic state to liquid state.

			"question": "2. The atterberg limits of a clay are: LL = 60%, PL = 45% and SL = 25%. The specific gravity of soil solids is 2.70 and the natural moisture content is 50%. What is its state of consistency in nature?",
			"answers": {
				"a": "50% firm clay",
				"b": "55% clay",
				"c": "40% hard clay",
				"d": "66% medium clay"
			},
			"explanations": {
				"a": "This is derived from the plasticity index vs liquid limit graph.",
